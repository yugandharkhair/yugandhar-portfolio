My somewhat unique approach to make my portfolio website where I can showcase the stuff that I do and have done in a different and cool way! This project was such a bundle of new learnings and refreshers. Learnt to use technologies like Three.js, Next.js, GSAP, Slice Machine and Prismic. Here is a detailed breakdown! üëáüèº

**Concepts that I learned by developing this project:**

- Three.js! What an amazing javascript library. Makes it possible to use 3D elements in the website and interact with them in various different ways.
- GSAP! Another awesome library that helps in creating all the animations. From hover animations to SVG animations! It can all of them. And the best part, its totally free.
- Prismic. It is a headless page builder for websites that makes it super easy to add content in your website without hard coding any of the stuff. Learnt how to use it and different tsx tags provided.
- Using slice machine for creating different slices throughout the website that are re-usable and fetch content from prismic.
- Using Aria-labels throughout the whole site to make it easier for screen-readers to go through the site without sounding like a mess.

Overall, I understood the advanced technologies currently in demand in the world of development. This website was inspired from Alex Trost's video. I really hope this can give me a better visibility for my work and skills. Do let me know if you have any suggestions. Cheers!
